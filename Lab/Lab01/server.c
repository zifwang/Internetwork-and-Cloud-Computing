     *          1. stream socket (SOCK_STREAM) in which characters are read in a continuous stream as if from a file or pipe
     *          2. datagram socket (SOCK_DGRAM) in which messages are read in chunks.
     * The third argument is the protocol. If this argument is zero (and it always should be except for unusual circumstances), the operating system will choose the most appropriate protocol. It will choose TCP for stream sockets and UDP for datagram sockets.
     * The socket system call returns an entry into the file descriptor table (i.e. a small integer). This value is used for all subsequent references to this socket. If the socket call fails, it returns -1.
